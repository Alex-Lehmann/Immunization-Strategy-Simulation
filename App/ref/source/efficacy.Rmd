We referred to the results of the manufacturers' clinical trials for estimates of the efficacy of the currently-available COVID-19 vaccines. When used as intended, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was 95% effective^1^ in preventing COVID-19 and the Moderna vaccine was 94.1% effective^2^. For the purposes of our simulation, we assumed that the two were equally effective at 95%.
