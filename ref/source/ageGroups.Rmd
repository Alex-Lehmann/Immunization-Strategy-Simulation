Given the available data for age-related mortality, we chose to divide the province's population into ten-year wide age groups. This data was collected in the 2016 Canada Census and retrieved using the CensusMapper API^1^. The populations of each age group can be seen below.  

```{r groups_out, echo=FALSE}
# Barplot
ggplot(groups, aes(x=`Age Group`, y=Population)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  ggtitle("Population of Ontario Age Groups, 2016 Census")

# Table
kable(groups)
```

```{r infection_groups, include=FALSE}
# Get number of cases in each age group
infectByGroup = read_csv("../data/conposcovidloc.csv") %>%
  mutate(`Age Group` = ifelse(Age_Group %in% c("80s", "90s"), "80+", Age_Group)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Age Group`), `Age Group` != "UNKNOWN") %>%
  group_by(`Age Group`) %>%
  summarize(Cases = n())

# Compute proportion of total cases in each age group
totalCases = sum(infectByGroup$Cases)
infectByGroup = mutate(infectByGroup, Proportion = paste0(format(100*Cases / totalCases, digits=3), "%"))
```

We also considered the possibility that each age group might be at different risk levels of contracting COVID-19. We considered the proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each age group, seen below.

```{r infection_plot, echo=FALSE}
infectByGroup %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Age Group`, y=Cases, label=Proportion)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  geom_text(vjust=-0.5) +
  ggtitle("Ontario COVID-19 Cases by Age Group, with Proportion of Total")
```

We clearly see that some age groups contain a far greater proportion of COVID-19 cases than others. We account for this in our model by weighting new COVID-19 cases more heavily toward those groups according to the observed percentages of cases.
